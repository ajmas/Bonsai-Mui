This project is an attempt to create a HTPC client using only Web based technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, WebGL and Javascript. The idea is to create a client side API that would asbtract the server side communication, and allow people to write custom user interfaces around it.

We will eventually need to either create or 'partner' with a server side HTPC solution to provide the content, but we would like to keep this as a separate project and simply document the service interfaces that would be used.

At the current stage this project is in the research and development phase, whereby we are trying to establish the best design and approaches. 

Target devices:
  - Desktop connected to HD TV, using a remote
  - Smartphone
  - Tablet
  
Stuff to do:
  - Establish the service layer protocol
  - Come up with UI designs and allow ways of making it customisable
  - Deciding on supported media types and what needs to be transcoded
  - Supporting plugins (server side or client side)
